### Test Plan

- Test plan outlines the common strategy that will be applied to test an application.

Test plan includes:

1. Introduction to the Test Plan document.
1. Assumptions while testing the application.
1. Approaches to be used while testing the software/application.
1. List of test cases used during the testing process.
1. Enumeration of features to be tested.
1. List of deliverables to be tested.
1. The resources allocated for testing the application.
1. A schedule of tasks and milestones to be reached.
1. Possible risks involved during the testing process.

### Test Cases

- Test case is a complexity of inputs, serious of steps, and conditions that can be used during the process of testing.

Each test case includes:

1. Test case ID.
1. Product module.
1. Product version.
1. Revision history.
1. Purpose.
1. Assumptions.
1. Pre-conditions.
1. Steps.
1. Expected outcome.
1. Actual outcome.
1. Post-conditions.

### Test Scenario

- Test Scenario - it is a one line statement which purpose is to inform what particular area in the application will be tested.

### Traceability Matrix

- a table that is used to trace the requirements during the Software Development Life Cycle. 

The main goals for this matrix are:

- Verification that the software is developed as per the mentioned requirements.
- Identification the root cause of any bug.
- Tracing the developed documents during different phases of SDLC.
