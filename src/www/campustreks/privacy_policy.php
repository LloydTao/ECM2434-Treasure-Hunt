                        <h3>Personal information</h3>
                        <p>We securely store email address of registered users in our database and all passwords are securely
                        encrypted. We use this information to allow users to create and host treasure hunts and so they can
                        reset their password. We also use the GPS location of users who are in an active game, so we can
                        check when they have reached a checkpoint.</p>
                        <h3>Requesting personal information</h3>
                        <p>You can view your personal information on your own account page, where you can also change your password.
                            If you would like to remove your information from our database, please contact us at campustreks@outlook.com.</p>
                        <h3>Privacy policy changes</h3>
                        <p>If we plan to make any changes to our privacy policy, we will inform users on the main home page, at least
                        2 weeks before.</p>
