                        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                        <p>We are a team of 6 students, all in our 2nd year of studying Computer Science at the University of Exeter. </p>

                        <h2>Our vision</h2>
                        <p>There is a problem at univeristies where students, especially new students, can find it challenging to find buildings
                            or lecturers. Therefore, we were approached to build a webapp that could send students on a treasure Hunt around the
                            univeristy, which is where the name <b>CampusTreks</b> originated.</p>
                        <p>We wanted to create a game, which is not only useful, but fun to all users. To maximise this, we didn't want to restrict the
                            playerbase to university students and so we developed the app to allow anybody to create their own treasure hunts around
                            the world and play with others.</p>
